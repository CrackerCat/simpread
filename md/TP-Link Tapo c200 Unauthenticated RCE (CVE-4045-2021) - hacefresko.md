$ nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.81 Nmap scan report for C200_F81AB2.home (192.168.1.81) Host is up (0.022s latency). Not shown: 996 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE 443/tcp open https 554/tcp open rtsp 2020/tcp open xinupageserver 8800/tcp open sunwebadmin

As you can see, the device has some interesting open ports. First thing I tested was port 443. Although `nmap` clearly indicates that it uses `https`, when I initially did the scan, I just overlooked it and spent quite a long time thinking that port 443 was running `http`. Because of this, I only tested `http://192.168.1.81:443` instead of `https://192.168.1.81:443`, so the only thing I got was 400 responses. As I said in the introduction, this journey was full of failures. Regarding the other ports, the services running on them were totally unknown to me and I didn’t find any clear information about them. At this moment, I ran out of known options, so it was time for further investigation.

Getting a shell
---------------

Before buying the camera, I looked online for previous research on the device and, luckily, I found this [Github repository](https://github.com/nervous-inhuman/tplink-tapo-c200-re) where people were collaborating to reverse engineer it. [One of the issues](https://github.com/nervous-inhuman/tplink-tapo-c200-re/issues/1) explains how to get a shell through the [UART port](https://www.embedded.com/understanding-the-uart/), which I knew nothing about at the time. So I learned the basics and bought a [USB to TTL converter](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B07CQTC8P2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to connect to it:

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/ARCELI.jpg)

With the help of the [mentioned issue](https://github.com/nervous-inhuman/tplink-tapo-c200-re), I was able to open the device with a knife and a screwdriver and quickly locate the UART. After a couple of tries and a lot of patience, I finally managed to solder some wires to the pads:

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/first_conn.jpg)

Then, it was time to test if the soldering was good enough for the data to be transmitted. I connected the wires to the USB adapter, taking into account that Rx of the UART goes to Tx of the adapter and vice versa, and connected the adapter to my computer. Again, thanks to the [mentioned issue](https://github.com/nervous-inhuman/tplink-tapo-c200-re), I knew the baud rate for the serial connection was 57600, so I executed `$ sudo screen /dev/tty.usbserial-0001 57600`, where `/dev/tty.usbserial-0001` is the USB port where the adapter is connected to, and powered on the device. I immediately started receiving data, great.

However, I didn’t have a shell yet. What I was receiving was just the booting sequence of the device, which actually was the U-Boot bootloader. It looked something like this:

```
U-Boot 2014.01-v1.2 (Jul 16 2021 - 18:41:10)

```

By typing enter, we are asked to input an username and password. Again, thanks to that [Github issue](https://github.com/nervous-inhuman/tplink-tapo-c200-re), we know the credentials, so we can successfully login with with user `root` and password `slprealtek` and finally get a shell.

Once I knew the connection worked, I needed to make the soldering less fragile, since it broke twice in the process of actually getting the shell. I applied some hot melt silicone to secure all the wires and closed the device again, disconnecting all motors. Now, my testing unit was ready to go:

```

We can see the processes behind those open ports seen in the `nmap` scan, such as `uhttpd` or `cet`. I focused specifically on the `uhttpd` process, since it’s the one behind the `https` server (which at that point I still thought it was `http`) and I was already very familiar with `http` protocols.

`uhttpd` is a web server made by OpenWRT to be used in embedded devices running this distribution. At this point, I wanted to know if I could get more information about it, something like the source code or, at least, the routes. I went to the [OpenWRT wiki](https://openwrt.org/) and learnt about `uhttpd` and OpenWRT in general. In OpenWRT machines, there is a system called [Unified Configuration Interface (UCI)](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci), which is basically used to easily configure system services. Using this, we can get the `uhttpd` configuration:

```
root@SLP:~# uci show | grep uhttpd
ucitrack.@uhttpd[0]=uhttpd
ucitrack.@uhttpd[0].init=uhttpd
uhttpd.main=uhttpd
uhttpd.main.listen_https=443
uhttpd.main.home=/www
uhttpd.main.rfc1918_filter=1
uhttpd.main.max_requests=8
uhttpd.main.cert=/tmp/uhttpd.crt
uhttpd.main.key=/tmp/uhttpd.key
uhttpd.main.cgi_prefix=/cgi-bin
uhttpd.main.lua_prefix=/luci
uhttpd.main.lua_handler=/usr/lib/lua/luci/sgi/uhttpd.lua
uhttpd.main.script_timeout=180
uhttpd.main.network_timeout=180
uhttpd.main.tcp_keepalive=0
uhttpd.px5g=cert
uhttpd.px5g.days=3600
uhttpd.px5g.bits=1024
uhttpd.px5g.country=CN
uhttpd.px5g.state=China
uhttpd.px5g.location=China
uhttpd.px5g.commonname=TP-Link
upnpc.uhttpd=entry
upnpc.uhttpd.proto=TCP
upnpc.uhttpd.ext_port=80
upnpc.uhttpd.desc=uhttpd


```

There are some interesting parameters here. First, `uhttpd.main.home` points to the server document root, so we may find some web server files. Next, `uhttpd.main.lua_handler` points to Lua handler script used to initialize the Lua runtime on server start, since `uhttpd` supports Lua scripts, so there may be more interesting files there. However, `/www` directory is empty and there is no `sgi` directory in `/usr/lib/lua/luci` nor `uhttpd.lua` file in the system. I kept trying to find anything about how this `uhttpd` instance worked but I found nothing, only configuration parameters pointing to nowhere.

At this point, I knew that the solution to this was to directly analyze the `uhttpd` binary and reverse engineer it, but before that, I wanted to create a testing environment so I could know what was happening inside the web server when I made the requests, since the way the process was created, there was no output anywhere.

I tried running the command found in the output of the `ps` command for process 861: `/usr/sbin/uhttpd -f -h /www -T 180 -A 0 -n 8 -R -r C`. However, I got a lot of errors and couldn’t make it work. Since I wasn’t able to create the same `uhttpd` process in a different port, I tried to go after the missing output by checking the `/proc` entry for the process, in order to try to read them if they existed (as explained in [this video from PwnFunction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SA6S9Ca5-U)). But there was a big problem:

```
root@SLP:~#sudo ls -l /proc/864/fd/
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Nov 10 22:44 0 -> /dev/null
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Nov 10 22:44 1 -> /dev/null
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Nov 10 22:44 2 -> /dev/null
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Nov 10 22:44 3 -> anon_inode:[eventpoll]
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Nov 10 22:44 4 -> socket:[1830]


```

All file descriptors for `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` were redirected to `/dev/null`, which is basically redirecting them to a black hole where they cannot be found. I was stuck and I didn’t know what to do. Since I was already in the `/proc` entry, I started looking around as I didn’t remember that `/proc` entries had that much information about a process and was curious about it. Thanks to this random curiosity I stumbled across the `environ` entry, which contains all environment variables for that process. One of these environment variables was `UHTTPD_ARGS=-h /www -T 180 -A 0 -n 8 -R -r C200 -C /tmp/uhttpd.crt -K /tmp/uhttpd.key -s 443`. I immediately realized that the command shown by `ps` was not correct and later found that it was because the UART shell didn’t have enough width to display all characters. Yet another fail that made me learn new important things: never trust the output given by a UART port.

Now I could finally create another instance of `uhttpd` with the exact same parameters and no pipes to `/dev/null` in order to test the binary while reverse engineering it.

Reverse engineering uhttpd with Ghidra
--------------------------------------

This was my first time using Ghidra. I had seen some videos and read some articles about it (thanks [stacksmashing](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja) and [liveoverflow](https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow) for the amazing and easy-to-digest content), but never really played with it, so this was a very good opportunity to learn.

I opened the `uhttpd` binary and, after some trial and error, figured out that the language was MIPS32, little endian, with mips16e. Some function names came by default with the binary, but others didn’t. I also spent some time renaming functions since, apparently, Ghidra is usually confused with external functions and you get strange wrappers for them like:

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/strange_wrapper.png)

I looked at the `main` function and other important ones to figure out the logic of the binary and how it was structured. I found some interesting ones, already named, among which were `do_login` or `uh_slp_proto_request`. I will talk more about the last one later.

After this initial contact, I started looking for bugs. Since I’m a huge noob with overflow vulnerabilities, the first thing I did was to search for `system`, `exec` and `popen` calls, in order to check if there was any command injection vuln that I could easily exploit. And oh boy, I was lucky.

Function `exec_and_read_json` uses `popen` to execute commands:

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/exec_and_get_json.png)

`exec_and_read_json` is used by 2 unnamed functions, which I named `set_language` and `wifi_connect`. They respectively deal with language and WiFi configuration (obviously). `wifi_connect` seems to parse single quotes (`'`), however, `set_language` doesn’t. This means that if we can control the input for the `set_language` function, we can successfully inject our own commands.

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/wifi_connect.png)

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/set_language.png)

Function `set_language` is used by `uh_slp_proto_request`, the function I mentioned before, which passes as input some parsed data received from the user.

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/main_func_1.png)

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/main_func_2.png)

To parse the user data, `uh_slp_proto_request` checks if it is a valid JSON object. Then, it gets a string value identified by key `"method"` and a dictionary value identified by `"params"` (at least that is what I think, since function call could not be resolved by Ghidra but seemed to work this way). Depending on the selected method, `uh_slp_proto_request` selects the function which will be called.

So, by sending `{"method": "setLanguage", "params":{}}` we successfully call the `set_language` function and pass `{}` as `language_json` parameter. Then, inside `set_language`, `language_json` object is converted to string and inserted directly into `"ubus call system_state_audio set_language \'%s\'"` to be executed.

By submitting `{"method": "setLanguage", "params": {"payload": "'; touch poc;'"}}`, `ubus call system_state_audio set_language '{"payload": "'; touch poc;'"}'` will be executed, which actually contains 3 commands: `ubus call system_state_audio set_language '{"payload": "'`, `touch poc`, and `'"}'`. The second one gives us full code execution.

Now, `uh_slp_proto_request` is used by another unnamed function managing all requests, which I named `main_server_function`. If a request is valid (does not exceed maximum length, uses `http` or `https` depending on the server config, etc.), `main_server_function` checks if the URL contains `/cgi-bin/luci` or `/web-static`. If it doesn’t, `uh_slp_proto_request` is called.

![](https://www.hacefresko.com/images/2022-02-11/uh_slp_proto_request_entrypoint.png)

By guessing and sending a couple of requests to the camera, we can check that data used by `uh_slp_proto_request` is regular POST data. So, if we send a POST request to `/` with the previous payload, `uh_slp_proto_request` will process this data, call `set_language` and our payload will be injected in the command executed by `exec_and_get_result`.

As you can see, I didn’t mention anything about authentication, since the `setLanguage` method can be called without login. This allows any user to take full control of the camera with just one unauthenticated request.

Exploitation
------------

Now, it’s time to write the exploit. I spent some time figuring out how to get a reverse shell with `netcat`. It seemed trivial but I couldn’t get it to work. I found out that the `netcat` version installed in BusyBox is quite limited in terms of functionality, so regular reverse shells were not valid. However, I found what I was looking for in [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#ncat) repository (as usual), and got the perfect reverse shell. Since `uhttpd` is running as root (thanks TP-Link), we get a shell with highest privileges just by sending a malicious POST request. The exploit is available at [my Github page](https://github.com/hacefresko/CVE-2021-4045-PoC):
